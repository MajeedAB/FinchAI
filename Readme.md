###Main idea:
Natural selection simulation, with Darwin's finches for contextualization.
Individuals have different beaks (variable length and width), that impact probability of eating certain things
Foods = fruits, seeds/nuts, insects

For reproducing: "life" timer (maintained w/ food), and chance of reproducing when 1) 2 birds touch, or 2) randomly w/ 2 random living finches

### Tasks to do:
- DNA, Population, and ENVIRONMENT
- Fancier animation
